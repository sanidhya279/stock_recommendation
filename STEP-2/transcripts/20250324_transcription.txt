Namaste. Welcome to CNBC Awaaz's "Kiladi Number One" live studio.  You are watching the first trading day of the week, the sixth consecutive trading session where we're seeing a significant rally in the market.  The Nifty is at a day high, up 258 points—over 1%—trading at 23,610.  The Bank Nifty is also seeing a significant rally.  There's considerable green across the board.  The Bank Nifty is up 1123 points—2.5%—hitting a day high of 51,782.  The small-cap and mid-cap indices are also witnessing strong gains today.  The mid-cap index is up 732 points, trading at a day high of 52,574.  Small-cap indices are also up significantly, with an increase of 211 points—1.5%—trading at 16,396.  The breadth looks excellent today. The market is surging.  There are 2,061 stocks currently trading higher, while 586 stocks are under pressure. Let's look at the Nifty contributors on your screens.  The heavyweights like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Reliance, and Kotak Mahindra Bank are showing strong gains, leading the Nifty 50 contributions.  However, the auto pack and IT pack are somewhat disappointing. Mahindra & Mahindra, Titan, Infosys, and IndusInd Bank are dragging the Nifty down.  The Bank Nifty contributors show a similar trend, with HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak, and Axis Bank—the private banks—performing strongly, pushing the Bank Nifty higher.  However, IndusInd Bank remains under pressure, contributing approximately seven points to the Bank Nifty's decline. Let's see if the market sustains this rally.  Initially, there was short-covering in the market, but whether this is the rally we've been expecting remains questionable. We'll discuss this in detail with our "Kiladis." Speaking of "Kiladis," let me introduce you to this week's competitors:  Arun Kumar Mantri from Mantri Finmart; Madhu Bansal from Finberg Management; and Brijesh L. J. from IDBI Capital. They will be with us throughout the week.  First, a warm welcome to all three to CNBC Awaaz! Good morning to all three of you.  All three are winners—one week each.  Now, a mega-competition begins. First, let's look at the returns. How did the portfolios perform? Arun Kumar Mantri's portfolio generated about 22.5% returns. Brijesh Ji's portfolio generated approximately 16.75% returns. Madhu Ji's portfolio delivered around 6.75% positive return.  All three emerged as winners in our previous episodes. Let's move on and start with Madhu Ji.  We've had six trading sessions with a significant rally.  How do you see this rally? Can it be said that the bull market is back, and that the market is trending strongly upward?

Good morning to you and all panelists.  Regarding the Nifty's recovery, we always rely on data to understand market trends.  FII and DII seem to be jointly driving this rally, as confirmed by the data.  Derivative positions, previously short, are now mostly covered. We expect the market to trend upward.  For this week, as we participate in this competition, both RSI and market profile indicators look quite positive.  The Nifty should ideally reach 23,650 to 23,950 this week, according to the market's current momentum.  Regarding the Bank Nifty, it's showing a weekly zone breakout above 50,700, and we can expect a target of 53,900.  

Therefore, significant targets are expected from the Nifty and Bank Nifty. Madhu Ji, you see a strong upward market trend. Arun Ji, can you share your views?  The market is witnessing a strong rally.  What does your analysis say? Should we remain cautious or can we be relaxed about the market now?

Good morning Shreya Ji, and good morning to all panelists. I believe the market could reach 23,800.  If you remember, the market fall started from around 23,800, going down to 21,900.  Clearly, the market is heading toward 23,750-23,800 without significant obstacles. The 23,500 level was an obstacle.  Call writers at 23,500 are heavily trapped.  I believe these call writers will push the market to 23,800.  I think the market should reach 23,800 immediately. The support is around 23,400.  I think the Bank Nifty is poised to reach 52,200-52,250.  51,400 is a strong support level for today. It is already 1,200 points above. I believe a rally of 300-400 points is possible from here.  Overall, I expect short covering for one or two days. Traders and investors should be cautious around 23,800. I believe 23,800 will act as resistance.

Arun Ji sees a Nifty zone of 23,800. Brijesh Ji, the market rally is evident in mid-cap and small-cap segments. What is your analysis and guidance for traders and investors?

Morning Shreya. Morning everyone.  Basically, we talked last week about a possible pullback, which, with the weekly closing, has been well-confirmed. I believe the Nifty and Bank Nifty are showing strong momentum. In the Bank Nifty, we have even crossed the 200-day moving average. I think this momentum will last until 24,000, as this is the expiry week and the shorts are trapped. Fresh buying is apparent.  Therefore, we are unlikely to see a significant price correction. Possibly, a period of sideways consolidation.  But definitely, we might see the Nifty around 24,000.  I would maintain a stop loss of 23,200.  A major reason is that we're watching FII positions in the index futures. They have covered almost 50% of their shorts. This indicates they might cover the remaining shorts before expiry, leading to an aggressively bullish trend.

That is the strategy and guidance on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the market.  A rally is expected. Now, let's move on to the picks. Arun Ji, let's start with you.  What is your first pick?

It's difficult to choose a stock in this market because almost all stocks are up 5-7% intraday. Still, Godrej Agrovet shows breakout signs.  It's a low-beta counter but performs well, and quite quickly. It's trading around 795-796.  I recommend buying Godrej Agrovet with a stop loss of 774.  I believe this stock can reach 862.  Therefore, the first stock pick is Godrej Agrovet.


Godrej Agrovet is a buy-side trade from Arun Ji, with a stop loss of 774. The target expectation is 862. Madhu Ji, considering the market rally, which stock is your first pick?

Coincidentally, my first stock pick is also Godrej Agrovet. Well, no problem. This shows how strong our conviction is. My first pick is BEL. It has been showing very good momentum for the last 10-12 days and I think there is good momentum here. The target is 330, and I'll use a stop loss of 295.

The first choice was Godrej Agrovet, but Arun Ji picked it already. BEL is the buy-side trade from Madhu Ji. This is a correct call, given the recent rally. The order book is strong, and brokerages are bullish. The target is 330, and the stop loss is 295. Brijesh Ji, what's your first pick? Were you also betting on Godrej Agrovet?

Madam, all technical analysts see the same charts. Agrovet was on my list too, maybe if you asked me first, I would have said that.

So what's your second pick?


I would go for a buy in Lodha. I think there is an opportunity here, around 1230. I can buy here, expecting a range breakout or a fresh breakout. I'll use a stop loss of 1205 and the target would be 1280.

Lodha also has a good rally; Macrotech Developers is trading near its day high. A buy-side trade from Brijesh Ji. The target expectation is 1280, and the stop loss is 1205. Godrej Agrovet must feel left out with three contenders.

Brijesh Ji, please share your second pick. I'm giving you the first chance this time.

Yes, madam. My second pick is Tejas Networks. I'm expecting momentum and a breakout. I'll buy at the current price, with a stop loss of 814 and a target of 890.

Tejas Networks also shows good momentum. It’s another buy-side trade from Brijesh Ji. You can expect a target of 890. The stop loss is 814. Madhu Ji, what's your second pick?  Which stock have you chosen?


My second pick is from the Realty sector. I find this sector interesting, especially for the coming week.  My second pick will be DB Realty. I'll set a target of 169 and a stop loss of 150.  All parameters show it's performing well.

DB Realty's chart shows a sharp recovery from the bottom, currently trading above the day high. You should buy DB Realty with a target expectation of 189, and a stop loss of 150.  The Realty pack is expected to rally, with DLF being another bullish stock that brokerages are optimistic on.  There was an analysts' meeting, showcasing a strong vision for the counter.

Arun Ji, what will be your second pick, and from which sector?

Capital Goods look promising. Frontline and mid-cap stocks are performing well.  Time Technoplast, a smaller Capital Goods company, shows a good breakout.  Buy at the current price, with a stop loss of 388. I think Time Technoplast could reach 458; a breakout above 400 looks likely. Therefore, buy this for the short term.


Time Technoplast is a short-term buy. The target expectation is 458, and the stop loss is 388. Arun Ji, what is your third pick?

My third pick is difficult to choose, given that stocks have already moved considerably in the last 40 minutes.  I recommend buying Ion Exchange. It has reached around 514-515 and I believe it can show good momentum from here.  The stop loss is small as the stock has already moved.  I've set a stop loss of 490, and I expect the stock to reach 572.

Okay.  Arun Ji, can you repeat the stock?

I am talking about Ion Exchange.

Ion Exchange.  The third pick is Ion Exchange.  Given the rally, many stocks are trading near their day highs, up 6-7%. Therefore, it's recommended to buy Ion Exchange. Let's repeat the target and stop loss. Arun Ji, please specify.

Buy at the current level, with a stop loss of 490. The stock is currently around 514. The stop loss is 490, and the target is 572.

The stop loss is 490. Madhu Ji, what's your third pick?

My third pick is Aptech.  Aptech is showing good momentum and is fundamentally strong.  If you want to hold it for the long term, that is also an option. Target: 337, stop loss: 299.


The stop loss for Aptech is 299 and the target expectation is 337.  Brijesh Ji, please share your third pick. It will be a buy-side trade, correct?


Yes, definitely, madam. My pick is Pradeep Phosphates, trading around 101. I would buy this, with a stop loss of 98 and a target of 110.

Pradeep Phosphates is a buy-side trade. The stop loss is 98. Brijesh Ji, can you repeat the stop loss?

98.

The stop loss is 98. The target, please repeat.

110.

110.  You can expect a target of 110, with a stop loss of 98. Pradeep Phosphates is on your screen.  We'll take a short break.  We'll be back shortly.
